â€¢ A business has two types of users: staff and clients. 
    Staff members can perform actions to help run the business while clients interact with the business by buying products and services. 
    The two types of users aren't completely different however, they both have logins and profiles. 
    
    Describe in words (no source code) what classes you'd create to model users for this business and any relationships between classes 
    (no need for properties or methods).

Answer:


I believe that there are different ways for this situation, which may change according to the business rules.
At first I can imagine 2 possible solutions.
In both solutions the users are stored in a common "users" table, with a flag indicating whether this user is "staff" or "client",
in addition to a flag indicating if you are a "superuser", which cannot be removed via the application.

# 1. Solutions with fixed profiles and permissions, such as Administrators, Manager Supervisors, etc.
- For this solution, I would work with the relationship of 2 tables in the database (Permissions and Users), and then I would control through
    middleware layered application.

# 2. Per-User Permission Solutions.
- This is a more complex solution but offers more flexibility. Imagining that the system is based on modules, a user can create profiles and
    ask for module licenses.
    For this, in addition to the "profiles" and "users" tables, there would be a table to list the system "modules" in addition to a user table
    "profile_module" where the application would make a query through a middleware.
